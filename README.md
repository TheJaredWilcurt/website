### What you can contribute to this project:

* If you have i18n experience, we'd love the project be converted to use JSON based translation files
* The site could be optimized with tools like Grunt or Gulp to automate concat/minify/uglify JS
* Middle-Tier API stuff! Right now we are manually updating the `api.json` and `config.json` files. This process could obviously be improved.
* Graphics work. Whoever created the original design didn't put the source files (PSD/AI) into the repo making updates difficult.
